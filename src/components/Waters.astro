                I'm based in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana, and the range of water I get to
                fish is something I never take for granted. From classic freestone rivers to legendary
                tailwaters, intimate spring creeks, productive reservoirs, and carefully managed private
                waters, I tailor each trip to match the season, conditions, and what you're looking
                to get out of your time on the water. Whether you're chasing rising trout with dry flies
                or hunting larger, more aggressive fish with streamers, I'll put together a day that fits.

                I regularly guide on iconic rivers like the Gallatin, Yellowstone, Madison, Jefferson,
                Boulder, and Missouri, each with its own character and challenges. Freestone systems
                like the Gallatin, Yellowstone, Boulder, and upper Madison offer fast water, structure-rich
                runs, and visual dry-fly opportunities. Tailwaters like the Missouri and lower Madison
                deliver consistent flows, dense trout populations, and some of the most technical nymph
                and dry-fly fishing in the region. Spring creeks and private waters round things out with
                low-pressure environments and exceptional sight-fishing when conditions align.

                Beyond rivers, I have access to reservoirs and select private fisheries that open up
                opportunities during runoff, shoulder seasons, or when you just want something different.
                Whether we're floating a big Western river, wading a quiet spring creek, or exploring
                stillwater for trophy trout, flexibility and time well spent on the water are what drive
                every trip I put together. Southwest Montana is home, and my goal is to give you an
                authentic, high-quality fishing experience across its finest waters.
